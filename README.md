# Gun-Violence-Tracker
Mapping gun violence

Authors: Heidi Laursen, James Mason, Maria Romero, Kenny Suh

## Problem Domain \& Proposed Solution
Gun violence incidents have been on the rise in the United States. However, there is not very many sites that have a lot of information and data compiled into an organized fashion. There are many sites that just have "raw" data, where the information is in vast tables. And there are many sites that transform the data, but skew it in their favor to get across their point.

We want to create a website that encapsulates the large amount of data and present it to our users in a way that it is easy to understand and interpret with visualization.

## Data Collection
We also want to put focus on how there isn't much data publically out there. We found that GunViolenceArchive has live updates and good data, but they only have data for one year at a time. We contacted them for the full data set, but no response was received. For international data, we tried using the data provided by the UNODC, but a lot of the rows had blanks for uncollected numbers, so we switched over to a purified version of the data from the GBD and used just the deaths that were from firearms. But even that was not the most ideal because most of the numbers dealt with comparison to other death rates because the whole website is dedicated to any deaths in general.

## User Stories
### Maps
As a user, I want to see a map of the world based on gun violence incident numbers so that I can compare across different regions.

As a user, I want to be able to see a street view of each gun violence incident so that each incidence seems more realistic, instead of a dot on a map.

As a user, I want to be able to see a visualization of the map based on different parameters like year and location.

As a user, I want to be able to retrieve the specific URL of the map view that I currently have on my screen so I can share it with others.

As a user, I want my settings on my map to persist through browser reloads.

### Contacting Local Representatives
As a user, I want to be able to look up and/or contact local representative to my area so that I can inquire about gun violence issues/legislation.
